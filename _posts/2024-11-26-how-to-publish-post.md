# How to Publish Your Blog Post on GitHub Pages

- 1. Write Your Blog Post
Start by writing your blog post in Markdown (.md) format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple syntax.

- 2. Add Your Post to Your GitHub Repository
Once your post is ready, create a new repository or navigate to your existing GitHub Pages repository. Add your Markdown file to the `_posts` folder of the repository. The file should follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. For example: `2024-11-26-my-first-post.md`.

- 3. Configure Your GitHub Pages Site
Ensure your repository has GitHub Pages enabled. Navigate to your repository settings, find the GitHub Pages section, and select a source branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`). If you're using Jekyll, ensure you have a `_config.yml` file to configure your site's settings.

4. Preview and Publish

After pushing your changes to the repository, GitHub Pages will automatically generate your site. Visit `https://<username>.github.io/` to see your blog post live.
